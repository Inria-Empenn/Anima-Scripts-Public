# Anima-Scripts-Public
Open source scripts for medical image processing from the VISAGES team

This repository includes python scripts (for execution on a standalone platform and some on an [OAR](https://oar.imag.fr) cluster). Their goal is to combine several tools from [Anima public](https://github.com/Inria-Visages/Anima-Public/) to accomplish more complex tasks (atlasing, diffusion imaging, brain extraction...).

## Installation

Anima-Scripts-Public only requires two packages and a data package:
- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [Anima public](https://github.com/Inria-Visages/Anima-Public/)
- [Anima scripts data](https://team.inria.fr/visages/files/2018/09/Anima_Data.zip): data required for some scripts to work (brain extraction and diffusion scripts)

Installation requires only a few steps described in the [installation page](https://github.com/Inria-Visages/Anima-Scripts-Public/wiki/Installation)
