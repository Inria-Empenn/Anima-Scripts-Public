# Anima-Scripts-Public
Open source scripts for medical image processing from the Empenn team

This repository includes python scripts (for execution on a standalone platform and some on an [OAR](https://oar.imag.fr) cluster). Their goal is to combine several tools from [Anima public](https://github.com/Inria-Visages/Anima-Public/) to accomplish more complex tasks (atlasing, diffusion imaging, brain extraction...).

## Installation

Anima-Scripts-Public only requires two packages and a data package:
- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [Anima public](https://github.com/Inria-Visages/Anima-Public/)
- [Anima scripts data](https://team.inria.fr/visages/files/2018/09/Anima_Data.zip): data required for some scripts to work (brain extraction and diffusion scripts)

Installation requires only a few steps described in the [installation page](https://github.com/Inria-Visages/Anima-Scripts-Public/wiki/Installation)

## Reference Anima scripts

If you are using Anima scripts for your research, please take the time to:

- Cite the relevant papers referenced in the other pages of this documentation wiki or in Anima
- Add a sentence in your acknowledgments section or in the methods part of your paper referencing the [RRID](https://rrid.org) of [Anima](https://github.com/Inria-Visages/Anima-Public): RRID:SCR_017017, and the one of Anima scripts: RRID:SCR_017072 (should be written like this to ensure it is recognized by search bots)
